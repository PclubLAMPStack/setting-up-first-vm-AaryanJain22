Steps to install VM are as follows:

1)Install VMware Workstation Pro on host machine.

2)Open the command prompt or terminal window on host machine.

3)Navigate to the directory where VMware Workstation Pro is installed. For example, on a Windows machine, the default installation directory is *"C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation"*.

4)Use the "vmware-vdiskmanager" tool to create a new virtual disk for the VM. For example, we can use the following command to create a new 40GB virtual disk named "MyVM.vmdk" in the directory "C:\VMs":
```
vmware-vdiskmanager -c -s 40GB -a ide -t 0 C:\VMs\MyVM.vmdk
```

5)Use the "vmrun" tool to create a new virtual machine with the desired settings such as CPU, RAM, storage, and network configuration. For example, we can use the following command to create a new virtual machine named "MyVM" with 2 vCPUs, 4GB of RAM, and the virtual disk we created in the previous step:
```
vmrun -T ws createvm "C:\VMs\MyVM\MyVM.vmx" -h <cpu-count> -m <memory-size> -d "<disk-path>" -n <network-adapter>
```

6)Install the operating system on the virtual machine using the command-line interface or by mounting an installation of ISO image (http://centos.excellmedia.net/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-2009.iso) of size 4.4G

7)Once the installation is complete, configure the operating system and any desired software or applications.
